# Catalyst UI

A non-opinionated UI component library for Flutter apps.

**Note: The packages is currently in the very early stages of development and does _not_ have enough features for use in real apps yet.** If you're interested in contributing that would help us get to 1.0 sooner!

## Philosophy

Flutter deserves a real alternative to the Material package. Material is great, as long as you're okay to live within its contraints. But for teams with custom design languages and systems, Material is a burden. Developers have to shoehorn their own design system into the Material system, and direct translation isn't always possible.

The purpose of Catalyst UI is to provide a **non-opinionated** set of customisable components with which teams can develop their own design systems and component libraries. It provides a number of common components out-of-the-box, and we're planning to add support for custom component types.

## Roadmap

Right now I have no idea when Catalyst UI will be ready to use. It feels like a prototype at the moment which, over time, I'll add more functionality to. Contributions from the community are always appreciated.
